# AutoLineup
A small experimental AutoLineup menu

This radialradio menu tracks your mouse position and auto selects the lineup when you hover over it (similar to ```cl_inventory_radial_immediate_select 1``` in the weaponwheel).
All the viewangle snapping + jumpthrow happens afterwards by simply scrolling the mousewheel.

Note the mouse tracking could be used on any menu (buymenu for example). Futhermore it could be used to move your mouse to lineup positions without insta snapping.


# How to install and use:

1. Place ```platform_english.txt``` into ```game\csgo\resource```.
2. Place the ```AutoLineup```-folder into ```game\csgo\cfg```.

6. A sound plays and the radialradio menu closes. Wait till you have equiped the smoke if you haven't already.

8. You've finished.
